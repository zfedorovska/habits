					<p>The quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. All big things come from small beginnings. Small changes often appear to
					no difference until you cross a critical threshold. Habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts
					for a lot in the long run. Habits in long perspective can work for you or against you.</p>		
					<p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve but on who you wish to become.</p>			
					<ol>
						<li>Identity</li>
						<li>Processes</li>
						<li>Outcomes</li>			
					</ol>
					<p>In order to successfully work with habits let's take a look at habit loop. All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response and reward. The cue initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
					Cravings are the second step, and they are motivational force behind every habit. The third step is response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take
					form of a thought or an action. Finally the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goals of every habit. In conclusion bad habits don't mean that you are bad person,
					you are just in bad loop. So let's create some good habits loop and break old bad habits :)! Imagine you draw your portrait with habits help, what it will look like?</p>
